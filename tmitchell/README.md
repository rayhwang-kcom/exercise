Fonbuk 5000 manual:
Simply run the enclosed "exercise.py" file with python and it should open a menu (requires #!/usr/bin/python3)

At the menu screen you can enter the letters identified by the in-app instructions to run the associated commands (e.g. enter "a" to add a new user or "v" to save local data to file)

Try loading the "example" file to get some entries to test with.

Saved files will stored in the savefiles directory (PLEASE RUN THE PROGRAM FROM THE LOCAL DIRECTORY TO USE THIS FEATURE (e.g. use "./exercises", save/load functionality will not work if you run ))

The program sorts and searches based on entry name so no duplicates are allowed (it should try to prevent you from entering duplicates in any way but may not have all bases covered)
